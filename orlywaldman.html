The website was designed to be both day-to-day managable by Orly and easy to tweak when there are harder jobs to be done.

                                    <p>The home page of the site was designed to have a picture of one of Orly's best works as well as to drive customers to contact her. That is done with a clear call to action standing out on the page, a bright blue button as well as two testimonials underneath to show what good things her clients have to say about her services.</p>

In the Portfolio sections of the admin, the images can be rearranged using Drag &amp; Drop and thumbnails are generated automatically on upload. The uploaded thumbnails are then concatenated to create a thumbnail sprite for each section. In the reviews section there is also an active field to allow Orly to turn reviews on and off.</p>

The Masonry plugin was used to place the images into either 1, 2, or 3 columns depending on the screen size to make the gallery look polished. The blueimp Gallery was used to create the gallery lighbox that can easy to use mouse, keyboard and touch controls.</p>
